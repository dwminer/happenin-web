# About

Happenin' is a web application for people living in the same area to share what they're doing and invite others to join in! Using it is easy: Just open the web page and see what others have shared in your area. You can click on the "Create an event" button to share your own activity too, whether it be a hackathon, nature walk, study session, or pickup ball game! We hope that Happenin' can be a platform for people to meet new friends and form community bonds.
